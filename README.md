# SWARM OGGM Model
 A repository containing scripts for running OGGM for the SWARM project. These scripts require a modified version of the oggm source code that can be found at:  https://github.com/lkinnear/oggm and installed via the method detailed on the oggm website at: **[install the dev version + get access to the OGGM code:](https://docs.oggm.org/en/v1.1/installing-oggm.html)**.

To run oggm for the SWARM project please refer to the **[oggm website](https://docs.oggm.org/en/v1.1/run_examples/run_mb_calibration.html)** about running from pre-pro level 1 i.e. with your own climate data.
Running oggm will require mass balance calibration for the climate dataset used as detailed in the link above and file structures will need to be modified based on the user's directories.
